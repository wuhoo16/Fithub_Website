# TeamA13

This is the remote dev branch where we should push all of the most updated codebase for the IMBD project. Note that your should do all testing and ensure the new feature/webpage is working before submitting a Pull Request to this dev branch.

This will be the branch we use to merge into master right before each Phase deadline.
