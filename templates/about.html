        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p id="websiteDescription1">
            In today's world where desk jobs are prevalent, over 60-85% of people around the world lead sedentary lifestyles.
            This lack of physical activity can have serious implications for overall health and is attributed to about 2 million deaths every year.
            In fact, the World Health Organization states that "sedentary lifestyles increases all causes of mortality,
            double the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity, and increase the risks of colon cancer, high blood pressure,
            osteoporosis, lipid disorders, depression and anxiety."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p id="websiteDescription2">
            Here at Fithub, we believe that everyone around the world should have the resources

            popular fitness Youtubers to help your overcome these challenges. With our database, you can easily:

                    <p>This API was used to setup and activate the Youtube API. It includes supported API operations and syntax examples to get different details about channels related to fitness.
                    Channels, search, playlists, and video API operations were used.

                    <a href="https://wger.de/en/software/api">wger REST API</a>
                    <p>This API was used to grab data on 700+ exercises with information like exercise category, muscle groups, equipment, images, comments, etc. 
                    Out of the 700+ exercises, only 110 exercises were used since they were approved, in english, and had information for name, description, category, and equipment.
                    The request made to the API was parsed into a JSON format. Then, the 110 exercises were filtered out along with specific information for each exercise. 
                    Since over half of the exercises didn't come with images, the Google Custom Search JSON API was used to search for images related to each exercise.

                    <p>
                        This API was used to do a Google image search. We sent an HTTP GET request to the URI and passed in specific parameters like image file type, API key, search engine key, and search string.
                        The call returns a response which contains a Search instance. The Search instance contains information from the search result which we used to grab the image URLs.
                        The image URLs were saved corresponding to the exercise.

                    <p>
                        SERPSTACK was the API we used for finding results for fitness equipment. First, we did a pull to get an
                        example JSON file of the search results, then used the information in the JSON file to construct a
                        method for making a list of Equipment objects. We then used this list in the Equipment page to list
                        search results in a grid.

                        GitHub was our source for collaboration and code merging. Most individual work was done in individual
                        branches and was then merged to the 'dev' branch.
                        We also used issue tracking to fix problems with our project and GitHub project boards to keep track of user stories.

                        Our group used Slack for communication and for assigning tasks. We integrated our Slack with our Github
                        repository so we would be notified about updates, issues, and tasks.
                        In Slack, we have several channels like general, imdb-web-app, sources-and-links, and aboutme to organize our communication better.
